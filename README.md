# The Day Planning Application

This day-planner app is was designed to help the user keep track of their tasks for different times of the work day.

Key features:
+ Color codes past, current, and upcoming tasks
+ Saves data to browser so when refreshed the user doesn't lose their list
+ Shows the data and time at the top of the page

Please note: Still working on the code - need to get the save to local storage to work + get the color coding to work as well. Also, flesh out this readme a bit more.
